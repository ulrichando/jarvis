# Voice-agent rules (loads only when working in src/voice-agent/**)

These constraints are load-bearing. Don't remove or weaken without the user's sign-off.

**Monkey-patches must remain installed.** [jarvis_agent.py](../../src/voice-agent/jarvis_agent.py) installs ~13 patches at import via `.install()` (grep `\.install()` for the live list). The provider-critical ones: `deepseek_roundtrip`, `tool_name_sanitizer`, `strict_schema_relax`, and `anthropic_strict_schema` (added 2026-05-11 — Anthropic rejects any tool whose object nodes don't set `additionalProperties: false`, and `strict_schema_relax` emits legacy schemas that omit it; the sanitizer fixes the schema post-build). Removing one breaks DeepSeek + Groq + Anthropic reliability. They're idempotent — safe to re-import, never to delete. NOTE: `AcousticTap` is **not** a monkey-patch — it's a prosody class (`pipeline/prosody.py`) instantiated at runtime, not installed at import; earlier docs wrongly grouped it here.

**No subagent layer.** The `subagents/` tree was torn down in the 2026-05-20 rebuild and never restored — there is no `HandoffSubagent` / `DelegatedSubagent` / tool gate / `transfer_to_*` / `delegate`. The supervisor does everything via direct registry tools (`computer_use` for desktop GUI / screen-reading, `browser_task` for browsing, `terminal` for named shell actions, file/code tools + plan-mode for code). Don't restore subagent terminology in prompts or docs without the user's sign-off.

**STAY-IN-SUPERVISOR rule** lives in [prompts/supervisor.md](../../src/voice-agent/prompts/supervisor.md). For conversational/ambiguous/emotional input ("Jarvis, mute" / vague fragments / yes-no), the supervisor just REPLIES — it does not reach for a tool. Tools are for concrete, nameable actions. This rule was added 2026-05-07 after a live failure where over-routing trivial input produced "I'm here to assist with desktop tasks" boilerplate for 11 turns.

**Per-route `min_words` lives in [pipeline/turn_router.py::_ROUTE_BASE](../../src/voice-agent/pipeline/turn_router.py).** **All routes are 0 as of 2026-05-18** (was BANTER=1/TASK=3/REASONING=3/EMOTIONAL=3) — Whisper Turbo is final-only so "min_words=N" required STT confirmation that never arrived until after the user stopped, defeating barge-in; barge-in is now VAD-gated via `min_duration`. Single-word "stop / wait / cancel" also fires via the kill-phrase regex in jarvis_agent.py, bypassing min_words. (CLAUDE.md is authoritative here; this line was stale until 2026-06.)

**`resume_false_interruption` is OFF on purpose.** LiveKit's `pause()` is broken on the SFU output (gates new frames, doesn't clear queue). Disabling routes every barge-in to `interrupt() → clear_buffer() → clear_queue()`. Don't re-enable without verifying the SFU path. Comment + assignment at [jarvis_agent.py:4538-4555](../../src/voice-agent/jarvis_agent.py#L4538-L4555).

**`handoff_text_suppressor` walks the FULL chat_ctx**, not the last 15. The 15-item window dropped `task_done` past it in busy sessions, then suppressed all supervisor text indefinitely. Cost is O(n), bounded by `CTX_MAX_TURNS=80`. (Residual — no subagent emits `task_done`/`transfer_to_*` now; the suppressor stays as cheap defense against the old shapes leaking into reply text.)

**Confab-detector tool-evidence lookback is 10 messages.** **Strict-default since 2026-05-19 (L2 confab fix):** bare `transfer_to_*` / `delegate` does NOT count as evidence — required: a structured `tool_result` (role:'tool' OR `FunctionCallOutput` shape) OR a non-handoff tool_call. (Residual — `transfer_to_*`/`delegate` no longer exist; the rule stays as defense, and every direct-tool call produces the structured `tool_result` it wants.) Legacy permissive rule survives as kill-switch `JARVIS_CONFAB_STRICT_DISABLED=1`.

**Don't restart `jarvis-voice-agent.service` while a session is active.** Check `~/.local/share/jarvis/turn_telemetry.db` for the latest `ts_utc`; if within 60s, ask the user first.

**TTS is Groq Orpheus via `_LoggingGroqTTS` shim.** Don't replace with ElevenLabs (removed 2026-05-01) or other providers without coordinating the dispatcher in [pipeline/dispatching_tts.py](../../src/voice-agent/pipeline/dispatching_tts.py).

**Voice-agent has its own `.venv`** at [src/voice-agent/.venv/](../../src/voice-agent/.venv/). Don't use the project root venv or system Python — the voice-agent's livekit-agents version is pinned.

**Tests:** `cd src/voice-agent && .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/`. 800+ tests; full suite runs in ~25s.

**Logs live at `~/.local/share/jarvis/logs/voice-agent.log`** (NOT `/tmp/...` anymore — was switched 2026-05-07 because `/tmp` rotates aggressively and we lost the 11:57 SFU disconnect evidence). Rotated daily by `jarvis-log-rotate.timer` (50MB cap or 24h, gzip, keep 14). Old archives: `~/.local/share/jarvis/logs/voice-agent.log.<stamp>.gz`. Use `zgrep` for historical searches across archives.

**`total_audio_ms` was hardcoded to 0 across 1167 turns** until 2026-05-07. Now wired via `_on_agent_state` accumulator in [jarvis_agent.py](../../src/voice-agent/jarvis_agent.py): captures sum of all `speaking → not-speaking` segments per turn, including partial captures on barge-in. Resets after each turn-write. New rule: **never hardcode a telemetry field to 0 with a "not measured in v1" comment** — wire it or drop the column. Blind metrics make debugging impossible.
