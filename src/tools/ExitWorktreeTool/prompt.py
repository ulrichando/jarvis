def get_exit_worktree_tool_prompt() -> str:
    return """Exit a worktree session created by EnterWorktree and return the session to the original working directory.

## Scope

This tool ONLY operates on worktrees created by EnterWorktree in this session. It will NOT touch:
- Worktrees you created manually with `git worktree add`
- Worktrees from a previous session (even if created by EnterWorktree then)
- The directory you're in if EnterWorktree was never called

If called outside an EnterWorktree session, the tool is a **no-op**: it reports that no worktree session is active and takes no action. Filesystem state is unchanged.

## When to Use

- The user explicitly asks to "exit the worktree", "leave the worktree", "go back", or otherwise end the worktree session
- Do NOT call this proactively -- only when the user asks

## Parameters

- `action` (required): `"keep"` or `"remove"`
  - `"keep"` -- leave the worktree directory and branch intact on disk.
  - `"remove"` -- delete the worktree directory and its branch.
- `discard_changes` (optional, default false): only meaningful with `action: "remove"`. If the worktree has uncommitted files or commits not on the original branch, the tool will REFUSE to remove it unless this is set to `true`.

## Behavior

- Restores the session's working directory to where it was before EnterWorktree
- Clears CWD-dependent caches so the session state reflects the original directory
- Once exited, EnterWorktree can be called again to create a fresh worktree
